Scroll down to the part with IDS_. Translate the text within quotation marks.
The IDS_ strings should not be altered, they are only used by the compiler.

Some strings have a $ sign. It will be changed to something else. If it is removed,
the default (English) string will be loaded instead.

Menu commands may have one & sign. It is placed before a letter to make it an
access key. You have to make sure that every command in a menu has different access
keys.
Everything after \t appears to the right. It shows the shortcut keys. Changing
this text will NOT change the shortcut key.

IDS_TRANSLATOR_NAME may include a hypertext link. It will be displayed as blue,
underlined text and will open the default browser or e-mail program when clicked.
[address;link text] To make it an e-mail address just write mailto:address.
You can also write ?subject= to provide a default subject.
Example: [mailto:torbjrn@emuunlim.com?subject=Translation;Torbjörn Söderstedt]
